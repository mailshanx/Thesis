Modern digital communication systems can implement a variety of modulation and error coding algorithms. 
Many of these algorithms have parameters that can be set via software, thus affecting the communication
performance. This thesis describes algorithms to perform such ``tuning" of a point to point communication 
link. Specifically, we focus on data driven approaches to link tuning, with an objective of maximizing
average data rate in the context of an underwater communication channel. Our algorithms are implemented 
on an OFDM based underwater acoustic modem, with experimental results from a tank and lake based underwater channel.
